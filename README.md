## 1. Key Footfall and Analytical Insights
The analysis reveals an average daily footfall of **1.83M** pilgrims with an accommodation usage rate of **89%**.

* **Ghat Preferences:** Ram Ghat (20M) and Sangam Ghat (19M) are the most preferred locations for pilgrims.
* **Temporal Patterns:** Peak footfall is observed mid-week on Wednesdays and Tuesdays.
* **Weather Impact:** Foggy weather causes a notable decline in footfall (1.52M) compared to sunny or cloudy days (~1.9M).

## 2. Security and Incident Management
Security concerns show a distinct pattern that does not strictly correlate with peak footfall days.

* **High-Incident Days:** Sunday (18.49%) and Monday (18.87%) exhibit the highest percentage of security incidents.
* **Strategic Recommendation:** Police patrolling and AI-augmented security surveillance should be prioritized during these 48 hours to manage the increased risk profile.

## 3. Waste Management Trends
A significant anomaly was identified regarding sanitation and waste disposal.

* **The Saturday Paradox:** Saturday observed the lowest footfall (9.2M) yet recorded the highest average waste dumping (277 Tons). 
* **Insight:** This suggests a lag in waste collection or a change in pilgrim behavior during the transition to the weekend.

## 4. Health and Medical Emergencies
Medical infrastructure load fluctuated significantly throughout the event duration.

* **Emergency Timeline:** Medical emergencies increased sharply at the end of the 2nd week. 
* **Trend Analysis:** The rate of increase slowed down after the initial surge, reaching a peak in the 6th week before trending downward.

## 5. Demographic Decomposition
The event saw shifting demographics over the 8-week span.

* **Gender Distribution:** Male and female footfall percentages are negatively correlated. Male participation was higher initially, while female participation grew significantly in later weeks.
* **Age Trends:** Senior citizen (60+) participation fell after the 3rd week. Conversely, adult (non-senior) participation increased.
* **Teenager Involvement:** Remained remarkably stable at approximately 20% throughout the entire event.
* **Foreign Tourists:** Participation increased steadily until the 5th week, followed by a decline in the final three weeks.
